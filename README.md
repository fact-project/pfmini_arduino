# pfmini_arduino
repo to collect pfmini arduino firmware

These 2 firmwares where not pushed for a long time to any repo. I can only hope the ethernet one was the one which is currently running 
on the arduino inside the camera. 

These two files where the only one I found on my old laptop, so I pushed them here.

Easy and True confidence can only be gained by reflashing the pfmini-arduino inside the camera,
next time it is open, with a certain firmware version and then immediately pushing it .e.g here and tagging it.
